<br/>

The colours used in the website were based off the colours used in the logo. The colour palette was then created by using the [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) website.

### Typography

The following two fonts were picked as they complimented each other.

 * Lora is used for the headers on the site. This is a serif font.
