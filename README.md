## Design

<br/>

### Colour Scheme

![Castleisland Christmas Market Colour Palette](assets/images/readme-images/coolors-palette.png)

<br/>

The colours used in the website were based off the colours used in the logo. The colour palette was then created by using the [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) website.

<br/>

### Typography

<br/>

The following two fonts were picked as they complimented each other.

 * Lora is used for the headers on the site. This is a serif font.
 * Montserrat is used for the remainder of the text areas. This is  sans-serif font.

<br/>

 ### Imagery

<br/>

 All images are taken from image sharing websites such as pxhere, pexels and unspla. These are correctly credited in the credits section.

<br/>

### Wireframes

<br/>

Wireframes were created for mobile and desktop.

<br/>

<br/>

### Features

<br/>

The website is made up of three pages. All of which are accessible from the navigation menu. 

<br/>

* All pages have:
  * A responsive navigation bar at the top of the page. This allows users to access every aspect of the site. The left of the navigation bar contains a logo which has the text 'Castleisland Christmas Markets'. This logo also acts as a link to the home page once clicked. To the right of the navigation bar there are links to the websites pages (Home, Festivities & Competition). Once the screen size is 600px or under the links to the right of the navigation bar are changed to a hamburger style menu. This is done to prmote a good user experience in providing an uncluttered look to the navigation bar on smaller screens. 

  ![Navigation Bar Feature](assets/images/readme-images/navbar-feature-on-different-screens.png)

  <br/>

  * A footer which contains contact information, a copyright text which also states the creator of the page and also social media links. These links are shown as icons to give a cleaner more modern look.

  ![Footer Feature](assets/images/readme-images/footer-feature.png)

<br/>

* The Home Page has:  
  * A Hero image section. This image is of shimmering crystals and candles. Image used to implement a festive tone.

  ![Hero Image Feature](assets/images/readme-images/hero-image-feature.png)

  <br/>

  * An Information and Pathway Section. This section comprises of three subsections (div containers). The first div includes dates, times and a brief introduction. The second div contains what activties are available. The third div informs you of the competition.

  ![Information and Pathway Section](assets/images/readme-images/info-plus-pathway-section.png)

  <br/>

  * A map section. The map section provides a google maps iframe which will show exactly where the markets take place.

  ![Map Section](assets/images/readme-images/footer-feature.png)

<br>
 
 * The Festivities Page has:  
   * A festivities grid section. This section is broken down into ten subsections. There are five div containers with text, each describing what different activities and experiences are available at the markets. There are equally five other div containers that are images in relation the text div adjacent (in desktop version) or above it (mobile version).

   ![Festivities Grid Section](assets/images/readme-images/festivities-grid-feature.png)

<br/>

* The Competition Page:  
  * A background image. This image is of a reindeer in Lapland. It is used as a decorative image to convey a message of what to expect if won.
  * A form. This is used to allow the visitors to enter their details and enter the competition. It is made up of name, email address, phone number, radio buttons for the possible answers, a checkbox to agree to the terms and conditions and an enter competition submit button. All input area must be filled in order to enter if not a message appears on screen to instruct users to complete areas that have been left blank.

  ![Competition Page Features](assets/images/readme-images/form-feature.png)

<br/>

* Future Implementations:
  * To create a gallery page. This would include images of some of the products that are available in the markets, people partaking in activities available in the markets and just of the market in gerneral. These would help first time visitors have a greater knowledge of what to expect if coming to see the markets.
  * A terms and conditions link to a seperate page. This would have the full details of the terms and conditions involved in the competition involved with entering the competition.
  * A thank you for entering page. Once the submit button is clicked the user is brought to a thank you for entering page and informs them of when the winner will be notified.
  * Use javascript to return to top function on mobile devices.

<br/>

### Accessibility

I have achieved a high level of accessibility by using the following:

* Using aria-labels.
* Ensuring there is a clear colour contrast throught the site. 
* Using semantic HTML.

<br/>

<br/>

### Solved Bugs

<br/>

1. The images were slowing down the load time of the website. I resolved this by compressing the images and converting them to webp format.
2. The Font Awesome link at the bottom of the page was also delaying load time. Chrome Dev Tools suggested to use 'rel=preconnect' to speed this up. This did increase performance.
3. When trying to create the hamburger menu, the toggle button using javascript was not working. However once I put the link to the JavaScript under the footer like the Font Awesome link it resolved the issue.
4. After running through the project with my mentor he noted that the images on the CSS grid are too streched on the full screen desktop. The solution to this was to give the grid container a max-width of 90%.
5. The hero image on the index page was looking very stretched and cut off in different screen sies. Once the background-size: cover was used this was resolved.
6. While creating the form for the competition page I had put the label before the input for the radio buttons and the checkbox to match the name, email and number inputs above. This reulted in the buttons and checkboxes to be placed after the text. This was resolved by changing the order and putting the input then the label.
7. A 'Find out more' button was created with a Button element with a link inside it. However HTML validator issued a warning informing me that an a element can not be nested inside as button element. I resolved this by replacing the button with a div and fashioned to be like a button.
8. The Chrome Dev Tools also showed a 404 error in relation to the favicon. I had not created a favicon so searched the internet for an answer. The site Stack Overflow had a thread that led me to including the following to the top of the page under the stylesheet - 'link rel="shortcut icon" href="#"'. This resolved the error.

<br/>

### Known Bugs

<br/>

I have no unresolved bugs.

### Full Testing

* The site was fully tested using a range of browsers (Google Chrome, Safari, Firefox).
* The site was fully tested using a range of devices (DELL Large Screen Monitor, ASUS Laptop, iPhone 13, iPhone 7, Huawei P40 and Samsung S8)
* The site was fully tested using Chrom Dev Tools to test the responsiveness on different screen sizes.
* Every link in the website was fully tested on all three pages. Each link worked as expected. All internal links leading to the relevant page and all external links leading to a new tab.
* The competition form was fully tested. All input fields need to be filled out in order to successfully enter the competition. If any information is left out the user is directed to complete any missing data. One radio button must be selected to provide an answer and the terms and conditions must be accepted to proceed.

<br/>

### Testing Users Stories

<br/>

#### First Time Visitors Goals
* I want the site to provide information on the activities and availability of services from the markets.

  * The social media icons in the footer provide direct access to the social media accounts.
